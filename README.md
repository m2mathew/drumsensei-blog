Latest version of HQ for drumsensei internet presence.

## Recent Updates

- Add [Presto Assistant](https://www.presto-assistant.com/), since I had been working on that for several years.

Coming soon: a who-knows-when-it-will-finish rewrite of this site using the awesome [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) system.

## Reminder to devs

- Use the `main` branch for development.
- When ready for a release, kick off the GitHub Action workflow titled "0) Start Release - minor version".
