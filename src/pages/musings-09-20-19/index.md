As a person in our filled-to-the-brim-with-technology world, I sometimes need to slow down. Getting words on a page/screen can be that outlet. This format is loosely based on link blogs like [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) or Dave Rupert's [Weeknotes series](https://daverupert.com/2018/12/rss-digest-no1/). But mainly, as I was catching up on the [newsletter](https://caitlinstudley.campayn.com/web_version/view/3d682138ac9d20f54f38e9d4007ee19e0e549354baf044812f78068ba4f1500c/Stakmail/205936/58430448/448362111) that my friend Caitlin Studley makes, her format inspired me to get back to writing!

This area contains musings about what I am thinking/learning/considering during the week.

In 2019 I have been more aware of my face staring into the little rectangle of light, my information phone. I started off quite strong in January with limited screen time and more reading of physical books. Sadly, that habit waned over the intervening month.

### Reading This Week

I haven't read a book cover to cover in a number of years, so 2019 is the year where I will finish several. This is my current array of books in rotation. Once upon a time, I was such an avid reader that I was reading at all times of the day. Since switching into that code life, I have mostly been building software instead. It's time to make the conscious effort to hold physical books again and stare at a screen less often.

- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) (3rd edition) by Marijn Haverbeke
  - A great way to learn (or review) a bunch of things about JavaScript and node
- [Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/gandhi/) by Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi
  - Given to me by my co-worker and friend Nitin Shetty when he returned from Mumbai a _while_ ago.
- [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/thinking-fast-and-slow-daniel-kahneman/1100169801#/) by Daniel Kahneman
  - I heard Merlin Mann mention this enough times on the [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) podcast. And then another friend mentioned it. I had to pick up a copy and learn how to think better.
- [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://managinghumans.com/pitch.html) (2nd edition) by Michael Lopp
  - Lopp — a.k.a. "Rands" on the internets — is one of my favorites. Impressive resume, excellent writing style, hilarious stories.

### Learning This Week

My day job has me learning the ins and outs of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) this week. All of the React patterns we know and love are available with the added twist of "No DOM". Our engineering team has best practices for CI/CD and app strucutre. Our assembled cross-functional team uses Atlassian's Confluence as a place to write up our "Project Poster" to outline the project. We are busy writing user stories, researching UI/UX of similar mobile apps, learning about submitting to the app stores, learning how to use React Native with small projects, and more.

My work at [Presto Assistant](https://www.presto-assistant.com/) has kept me busy in the early morning hours as I am converting a lot of JavaScript files to TypeScript. I hear it's all the rage. And my business partner recently gave a talk about TypeScript at the [ReactJS Dallas User Group](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJSDallas/events/pbbdwnyzmbnb/) that pushed me to give it a go in our app. We are aiming at beta-testing by early 2020 and launch by February. Still a lot left to do in Presto!

Keep leveling up!
